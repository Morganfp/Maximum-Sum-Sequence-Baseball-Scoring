# Maximum-Sum-Sequence-Baseball-Scoring
A program that solves the maximum sum sequence problem for a baseball scoring scenario. Given a sequence of at most 153 digits representing the runs scored in a game, the program uses dynamic programming to find the optimal way to divide the sequence into sub-sequences representing the innings, in order to maximize the total score.
